# Delta-Demo1
Repo where I practice functionalities of git and Github - new 

# Teacher :
Mrs Shraddha Khapra

# Student :
Mr Eish Chandeal

# The 4 step cycle : 
Untracked, unmodified, modified, staged

the files that already exist - tracked
the ones that are newly created - untracked - initially
untracked can go straight to staged after being modified

# After commit :
Back to the unmodified stage.

one set of reasonably good changes that we can club together
and then send.

# Now with commit :
out local machine's git will remember the changes
